# AI-Driven Intrusion Detection Using Hybrid VAE–GNN Architecture

A smart and adaptive Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that combines Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to detect anomalies and cyberattacks in real time.

# 🚀 Project Overview

Modern networks generate massive and complex data, making traditional IDS ineffective for:

1. Detecting zero-day attacks

2. Handling high false positives

3. Missing context-aware relationships between nodes

This project solves these challenges using a Hybrid VAE-GNN model that learns patterns, detects anomalies, and classifies attacks using graph-based intelligence.

# 🧠 How the System Works
1. Data Preprocessing

Cleaning – Remove noise and inconsistencies

Encoding – Convert categorical to numeric values

Normalization – Scale features

Graph Conversion – Transform data into a graph for GNN

2. AI Model Pipeline

VAE: Learns normal behavior → detects anomalies

GNN: Understands node relationships → classifies attack patterns
